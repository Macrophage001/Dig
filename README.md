# Dig
Dig - A customizable, resource-gathering mod for minecraft

Dig is a minecraft mod that allows the player to sneak-right-click on blocks, effectively 'digging' through the block,  for resources. 
The blocks that can be dug through, what tools you can use to dig through them, and what resources will drop, can all be defined using 
'.ds' files placed inside the mod's script folder. To learn more, please take a look at the wiki.
